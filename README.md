# AGE-YOLO

AGE-YOLO is an **accurate, generalized, and efficient** object detection framework designed for steel surface defect detection under industrial scenarios. It bridges the gap between lightweight design and high-precision performance.

## Overview

Steel surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial manufacturing for ensuring product quality. However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously achieve high accuracy, real-time efficiency, and stable generalization across diverse ind[gc10_data.yaml](..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2FUsers%2FYH%2FDesktop%2Fgc10-ok%2Fgc10_data.yaml)ustrial domains. 

AGE-YOLO addresses these challenges through three synergistic modules:

* **Feature-Context Multi-Aggregation Network (FC-MANet):** Replaces conventional bottleneck structures with **Faster-CGLU and Partial Convolution (PConv)**. It enhances nonlinear representation and adaptive feature selection, specifically targeting unstructured defect patterns while suppressing background noise.
* **Adaptive Cross-scale Fusion (ACF):** Dynamically aligns and integrates multi-level features using **dual spatial–channel guidance and learnable cross-scale compensation**. It ensures structural continuity for elongated defects (e.g., creases) and mitigates scale distribution shifts across datasets.
* **Shared Insight Focus Head (SIFHead):** Employs lightweight **shared convolutions** and **Group Normalization (GN)**. By enforcing scale-invariant encoding, it improves localization stability and sensitivity for small-scale anomalies, even under small-batch industrial constraints.

```

## 📂 Dataset Preparation

We provide two ways to acquire the datasets (**GC10-DET**, **NEU-DET**, **HRIPCB**). See [dataset/README.md](dataset/README.md) for detailed processing instructions.

### Option A: Pre-processed YOLO Format (Recommended)
Directly download the split and formatted datasets from our Hugging Face repository:
- [All-in-One Dataset ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YYYHHHH993/AGE-YOLO)


### Option B: Original Raw Sources
- **GC10-DET**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alex000kim/gc10det)
- **NEU-DET**: [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/park-sung-ho/neu-det-object-detection)
- **HRIPCB**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhatova/pcb-defects)

> **⚠️ Important:** Before training, please refer to [dataset/README.md](dataset/README.md) for mandatory data augmentation and path configuration instructions.
## Training

Ensure your data is prepared according to the instructions above, then run:

```bash
python train.py
```

## Val or Test

Run the evaluation script directly:
```bash
python test.py --split val
```
or 
```bash
python test.py
```

## Detection

Run inference on sample images located in `assets/samples`:

```bash
python detect.py
```
